# 2023

This year I decided to use Typescript as an excuse to learn the language. This project was generated use the [ts-aoc-starter](https://github.com/nrwl/ts-aoc-starter#running-the-puzzles). This project structure that was generated isn't how I would do it personally, but it was good enough to get started.

## Inputs

input files are in the same directory as the day.
